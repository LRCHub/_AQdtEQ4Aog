When I pretend
Everything is what I
Want it to be
I look exactly like what you had
Always wanted to see
When I pretend
I can forget about the
Criminal I am
Stealing second after second
Just ’cause I know I can / but
I can’t pretend this is the way
It will stay / I’m just
[Trying to bend the truth]
I can’t pretend I’m who you
Want me to be
So I’m
Lying my way from you
[No / No turning back now]
I wanna be pushed aside
So let me go
[No / No turning back now]
Let me take back my life
I’d rather be all alone
[No turning back now]
Anywhere on my own
‘Cause I can see
[No / No turning back now]
The very worst part of you
Is me
I remember what they
Taught to me
Remember condescending talk
Of who I ought to be
Remember listening to all of
That and this again
So I pretended up a person
Who was fitting in
And now you think this person
Really is me / and I’m
[Trying to bend the truth]
But the more I push
The more I’m pulling away
‘Cause I’m
Lying my way from you
[No / No turning back now]
I wanna be pushed aside
So let me go
[No / No turning back now]
Let me take back my life
I’d rather be all alone
[No turning back now]
Anywhere on my own
‘Cause I can see
[No / No turning back now]
The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you
Is me
This isn’t what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said
Would have you running from me
Like this
This isn’t what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said
Would have you running from me
Like this
This isn’t what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said
Would have you running from me
Like this
This isn’t what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said
Would have you running from me
Like this
You
[No / No turning back now]
I wanna be pushed aside
So let me go
[No / No turning back now]
Let me take back my life
I’d rather be all alone
[No turning back now]
Anywhere on my own
‘Cause I can see
[No / No turning back now]
The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you
Is me
